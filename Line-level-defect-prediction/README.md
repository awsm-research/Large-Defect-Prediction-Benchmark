# Research Artifact: Predicting Defective Lines Using a Model-Agnostic Technique

https://github.com/awsm-research/line-level-defect-prediction

This is a research artifact for the paper: **Predicting Defective Lines Using a Model-Agnostic Technique**. This artifact is a repository consisting of our
benchmark file-level and line-level defect datasets and results of our file-level defect prediction models. The purposes of this artifact are to enable researchers to discuss the predictive performance of the file-level defect prediction models, and to reuse the dataset for further software engineering research.

## Contents
* `Dataset` - our benchmark file-level and line-level defect datasets, including 32 releases of 9 software studied systems.
* `File-level_results.csv` - results of our file-level defect prediction models based on within-release and cross-release evaluation settings.
* `LICENSE.md` - [CC0 1.0 Universal.](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
* `README.md` - this file.
